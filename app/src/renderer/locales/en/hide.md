# Hide / Display
This control alternatively hides or displays the current selection.  
This is convenient to focus on a portion of the molecular model while retaining the representations of the rest.

**Beware** that when a selection or part of it is hidden, no action performed on it will be visible until the Display control is triggered on it.
