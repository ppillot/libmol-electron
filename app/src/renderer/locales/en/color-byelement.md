# Color CPK (by element)
Each atom is colored accordingly with chemestry's conventional coloring scheme ([CPK Coloration](lexicon-cpk)). This scheme informs on the different chemical elements that are part of a molecule.

Symbol | Color code | Element
------------ | ------------- | -------------
**C** | ![Carbon](static/img/c.png)| **Carbon**
**H** | ![Hydrogen](static/img/h.png) | **Hydrogen**
**O** | ![Oxygen](static/img/o.png) | **Oxygen** 
**N** | ![Nitrogen](static/img/n.png) | **Nitrogen**
**S** | ![Sulfur](static/img/s.png) | **Sulfur** 
**P** | ![Phosphorus](static/img/p.png) | **Phosphorus** 

**Beware**, most macromolecular models don't include **hydrogens**, despite those being present in reality. [Structures determination techniques](lexicon-technique) generally can't resolve hydrogen atoms coordinates.  

The labels in the status bar beneath the visualization frame, list the different atomic elements by their symbols and their respective colors.  
**Tip**: Hovering over the elements symbols reveals a tooltip with the complete atom name.
