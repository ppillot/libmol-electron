# Spacefill representation
![Spacefill](static/img/spf1.png)  
This representation displays:  
* **(1)** Atoms as spheres whose radii equal the Van der Walls radii, representing the closest distance one can get to the atom.  
* **(2)** Intersection between two overlapping spheres reveals a chemical bond (mostly covalent) between adjoining atoms.

This representation is used to visualize the atoms from a molecule and the volume they occupy. Applied to a complete molecule, it gives an idea about its actual shape.
