# Colour by residue
A residue regroups atoms that make a subunit of a chain (or polymer) in a molecular model. Each residue (or group of residues chemically akin to each other) has a specific color.

There are several types of residues depending on the biochemical nature of the chain.  
Main groups are:
* [amino acids](lexicon-aminoacid), that make proteins,
* [nucleotides](lexicon-nucleotide), that make [nucleic acids](lexicon-nucleic) (DNA or RNA).

Other kinds of residues, such as [ligands](lexicon-ligand) (saccharides, prosthetic groups, ions, etc...) and solvents (water) may also be part of molecular models.

Labels in the status bar beneath the visualization frame, specify every residue present in the model by its ID and its corresponding color.  
**Tip**: Hovering over a residue's ID triggers a tooltip with its extended name (if this information is available from the model file).
