# Select carbohydrates
This control selects **carbohydrates** (or **saccharides**) present in the molecular model. All saccharides are selected with this command indistinctively of their respective chemical nature.   

After selecting, it's possible to act (represent, color,...) upon these selected atoms without affecting the rest of the molecular model.

The pre-visualization of the selection is transiently displayed when the mouse hovers and makes it possible to check the quality of the selection made.
