# Select water
This control selects **water molecules** present in the molecular model. Generally they appear as isolated oxygen atoms because hydrogens positions can not be solved from the data gathered with most experimental structure determination [techniques](lexicon-technique). Only some of the water molecules present appear in the model as their position can vary between the different unitcells composing the crystal used for determination.   

After selecting, it's possible to act (represent, color,...) upon these selected atoms without affecting the rest of the molecular model.

The pre-visualization of the selection is transiently displayed when the mouse hovers and makes it possible to check the quality of the selection made.
