# Licorice representation (sticks)
![Licorice](static/img/st1.png)   

This representation use only segments between atoms (**the sticks**) to display the molecule.     
These segments provide informations regarding:
* **(1)** **atoms**, located at the ends of the segments generally marked by angles, 
* **(2)** **covalent bonds**, connecting two atoms.  

It is used to clearly visualize the covalent bonds between the atoms of a molecule.
It also provides a light outline of a molecule or part of it.
