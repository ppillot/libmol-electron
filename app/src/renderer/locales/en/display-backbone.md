# Backbone representation
This representation is a simplified display only applying to proteins and nucleic acids (DNA or RNA).  
![Backbone](static/img/squ2.png)  
The backbone is a broken line passing by one representative atom in each residue of the polymer: 
* in proteins, these are the **alpha-carbons** (Î±-carbons) of each amino-acid. Alpha-carbons join the pepdidic bonds with the amino-acid distinctive sidechains.

* in nucleic acids, these are the **C3'-carbons** in the nucleotides (deoxy)riboses.

The backbone reflects the structural basis of the polymer, around which the other functionally diverse compounds (amino acids side chains and nucleic bases) are organized and provide to the molecules their biological properties.
