# Colour by chain
This color scheme makes use of a different color for each chain present in the molecular model.

Prominent chains constituents are:
* [proteins](lexicon-protein), made of one or more amino acid chain
* [nucleic acids](lexicon-nucleic) (DNA or RNA), made of nucleotide chains

[Ligands](lexicon-ligand) (water, ions, hemes,...) in association with a biological polymer (protein or nucleic acid) are also considered as part of the chain and are colored like the rest of it.  

**Example: protein made of 4 chains:**

The labels in the status bar beneath the visualization frame, list the different chains by their IDs and their respective colors.  
**Tip**: Hovering over the chains name displays a tooltip with the chain's extensive and relevant biological name (if provided in the molecular file)
