# Colour by biochemical nature
This color scheme colors atoms accordingly with the biochemical nature of the compound they are in.  

Main compounds identified are:
* proteins,
* nucleic acids (DNA and RNA),
* saccharides,
* water,
* ions,
* [hetero atoms](lexicon-hetero).  

**Example molecular model with varied biochemical compounds:**

Every atom that is not part of a defined set is classified as hetero. This group is subsequently very diverse.  

Labels in the status bar beneath the visualization frame, specify every biochemical nature present in the model and its corresponding color.
