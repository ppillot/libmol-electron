# Cartoon representation
This representation provides a simplified view of **proteins** and **nucleic acids** (DNA or RNA). The cartoon only passes through the atoms that are part of the molecule backbone hiding the diverse side chains or nucleic bases.

In **proteins**:  
![Protein cartoon representation](static/img/rubanp.png)  
The cartoon passes through the peptidic bonds planes between successive amino acids. Cartoon width varies to emphasize noticeable secondary structures (beta strands, helices,...).

In **nucleic acids**:

The cartoon trace passes through successives riboses from each nucleotide. Nucleic bases are represented as sticks emerging from the cartoon. 

Due to computation limitations, this representation doesn't apply to chains shorter than 3 residues.
