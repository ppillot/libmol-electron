# Ligands
**Ligands** are small molecules linked to the studied macromolecules (proteins and nucleic acids). The ligands may be involved in the molecule function.
The chemical nature of the ligands can be either organic or mineral.
Organic ligands may be carbohydrates, lipids, hemes or any other organic molecules.
Inorganic ligands may be ions, metal atoms or other inorganic molecules.
The ligands attach to the macromolecules by covalent or non-covalent bonds (ionic, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals interactions).
